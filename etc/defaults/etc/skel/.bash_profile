#       base-files version 4.1-2
#
#       Executed by bash(1) for login shells.
#
#       The latest version as installed by the Cygwin Setup program can
#       always be found at /etc/defaults/etc/skel/.bash_profile

#       updating it autmatically.
#
#       The copy in your $HOME directory is yours, please feel free to
#       customise it to create a shell environment to your liking. If
#       you feel a change would be benifitial to all, please feel free
#       to send a patch to the cygwin mailing list.
